For more informations, check out my blog post: [Writing a ray tracer for the web](https://oktomus.com/posts/2020/ray-tracer-with-webgl-compute/).

While this ray tracer is not physically correct and boring, it's a good example of what you can acheive with compute shaders in web.

This was made possible thanks to WebGL 2.0 Compute, an experimental feature currently available on Google Chrome (Linux or Windows).

Many thanks to [9ballsyndrome](https://github.com/9ballsyndrome) for his help and especially for his repository [WebGL_Compute_shader](https://github.com/9ballsyndrome/WebGL_Compute_shader) where you can find really cool stuff made using WebGL 2.0 Compute.
